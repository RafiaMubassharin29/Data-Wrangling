Project Overview
This project focuses on data wrangling techniques to prepare and clean datasets for analysis. The goal is to transform raw data into a structured, analyzable format by merging datasets, handling missing values, formatting data types, and conducting basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Steps and Tasks
1. Data Sources
Dataset 1: Contains information on [description of dataset 1].
Dataset 2: Contains information on [description of dataset 2].
2. Data Wrangling Process
a) Merging Datasets
Combined Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 using a common key to create a unified dataset.
b) Handling Missing Values
Identified and filled missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., mean imputation, forward fill).
c) Renaming Columns
Renamed columns to ensure consistency, readability, and clarity.
d) Index Management
Reset the index after merging and cleaning the data.
e) Removing Duplicates
Checked for and removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
f) Formatting Data Types
Converted columns to appropriate data types (e.g., dates, numeric, categorical) for further analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed basic EDA to understand the data and extract insights, including:

Summary Statistics: Used describe() to analyze key statistics (mean, median, etc.).
Missing Value Analysis: Visualized missing data patterns.
Distribution Analysis: Examined the distribution of key variables using histograms and box plots.
Correlation Analysis: Checked correlations between numerical variables to identify relationships.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python: For data wrangling and analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing the data during EDA.
